This is an e-commerce site designed for selling digital products, such as license keys and files. It was developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with various libraries and frameworks, including Lenis, React, Tailwind CSS, Lit-HTML, and Lit-Elements.

The homepage features 3D object rendering and a high-contrast color scheme, primarily a combination of white, black, and dark purple, which gives the site a distinctive and modern look. Dynamic page rendering is achieved through PHP, utilizing templates and controllers for actions like adding to the cart, removing items, displaying product lists, validating payments, calculating taxes, and more.

User account and management are handled through a centralized authentication system, 'auth.dkydivyansh.com', which manages and validates user sessions on this site. Additionally, a pre-existing centralized mailing server is used for sending emails and notifications to users.
